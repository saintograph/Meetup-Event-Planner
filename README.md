Revisions completed for first cycle of resubmissions.

All React JS frontend code is in app/assets/javascripts.

Revisions :

 1. Issue ( fixed ) : Guest list not working consistently
 2. Issue ( fixed ) : Correct "type=date-time" for date input
 3. Issue ( fixed ) : Users can submit a from with invalid validation
 4. Issue ( fixed ) : All inputs must have appropriate types
 5. Issue ( fixed ) : All inputs must have labels
 6. Issue ( fixed ) : User can submit form without information
 7. Issue ( fixed, sorta ) : App must have build process. ( Not sure how to fix this one - Rails has its own way of handling JS, image and CSS assets, and React is part of the pre-rendered Rails backend )
